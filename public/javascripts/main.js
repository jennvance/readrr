people need to be able to do the following:


Phase 1:
HTML/CSS
Add name to email list (first name, email, whether author or not)
Apply to be a reader
Thoughts on the application: Should get basic info, ask a few short answer questions, and (after they submit?) maybe provide 
a short manuscript for the applicant to beta-read and respond within 48 hours. Once we receive the "Feedback", their
application is complete and we can proceed with the phone interview. After the phone interview, we'll send an email offering them
a spot or declining...and if we decline, we'll give THEM feedback and encourage them to try again at a later date. Maybe.

Phase 2:
Login capability
Authors will hit "Find a Reader"
Author will select various search parameters
Results will display readers who best match, in descending order of similarity.
Website will advise them to select from the top.
Author will upload manuscript, which will be sent to Reader's dashboard



Phase 3+:
